## Prerequisites

### IDE and compiler
You can use whatever IDE/Text editor/CLI you want, but you'll have to write code by your own.
I recomend [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) as it is cross platform, has a version which contains a compiler, and is less tempting to try drag-n-drop features.

If you chose CodeBlocks, here is how you start a project with it:
* Download. Better choose a version wich has compiler. Also it is a good idea to take last astable version (12.11), but it is not mandatory as 8.X is also good one.
* Install. After instalation it will ask you to choose a defolt compiler. Do it wisely.
* File -> New -> Project -> Win32 GUI project -> Next...
* In order to see only GUI window without console, in Project properties, set Build targets -> Type -> GUI Application
