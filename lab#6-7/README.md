# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #6-7

_You can choose to do your laboratory works using Win32 API, or you can switch to WinRT API. For Win32 API take a look at **lab#6** and **lab#7**_

_This laboratory work is a concatenation of lab#6 and lab#7. The deadline is as for lab#7. Mark will be cloned and assigned to both laboratory works' cells in my spreadsheet. You have to indicate in report that it is for both laboratory works._

_Take care, for working with WinRT API you'll need Visual Studio 2012 and .NET4.5_
