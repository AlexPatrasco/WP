## Report remarks

### About reports

* Do not put code in your report
* Next time use as an email topic which follows this pattern: [TUM][FAF Labs][WP] Name Surname
* Next time name your report file as - _WP FAF 111 Name Surname Lab#0_ (replace your name, surname and lab number)
* Inside your report - add a link to your lab repository (I know where it is, but it will be easier for me to locate your repository)
* Better use a report template provided in [repository](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP)
* You said nothing about PSG (At least choose one existent that matches your style. If it has any differences - mention them.)

### About repository

* Rename your folder names in your repository to follow **lab#0** pattern
* For each laboratory work add one README file (in its own folder)
* Keep your finished code in master branch. It is awesome that you get how to work with branches, but proposed work flow is a bit different: use master branch for submission ready code, and use other branches for development and testing. For details look at [submission process page](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/wiki/Submission-Process)
* It seems that you compiled your project before adding .gitignore. Please remove unnecesary files from repository (foldes _bin_ and _obj_) and next time check your staged files before making a commit.

### About code

* Your project code is padded using tabs and spaces (it is not consistent and looks strange from an editor with different tab spacing (mine has 1 tab = 2 spaces)). Try to setup your project/IDE in such an order that it will be consistent.

### General things

* Please make an effort and count your points
* Take in account that your next deadline is on 8th of march (even if it is holiday)
