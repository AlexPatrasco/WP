# Example of lab#4

Here is a simple board with moving balls.

Balls may interact:
* Balls are of different size, speed and have different movement directions
* Background changes its color
* On collisions they change color and moving direction
* If collision of 2 balls is bigger/deeper than 4 pixels then one ball will randomly teleport
* One ball leaves a movement temporary tail
