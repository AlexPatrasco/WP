## My Mood May Not Be The Same As My Facial Expression
If I don't smile it doesn't mean that I'm angry or in a bad mood. Sometimes while you are think everything around you dim.

## No Delays
Deadlines for laboratory works will not be delayed on students intention. However deadlines may be changed for other reasons.

## Other OSes
You may choose to do the same laboratory works for other OSes but:
- Only if you'll take Red Pill
- Your midterms and exams will be based on Win32 API
- You'll have to translate the tasks for your chosen environment

## Recomended IDE
CodeBlocks is a recomended IDE, hence many choose VisualStudio. Either way you'll have to write code. So no drag-n-dropping or XML defined layouts.
